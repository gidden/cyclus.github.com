Accessing and Using the Cyclus Virtual Environment
==================================================

Recognizing that the *Cyclus* install process may be a bit dauting at
first blush, the development team keeps an up-to-date 
`Virtual Box <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_
disc image available for download from its server:

  * `Download the image <http://http://cnergdata.engr.wisc.edu/cyclus/cyclus_user_environment.tar.bz2>`_ 

CAUTION: The file is *LARGE* (~1.5GB).

Using the *Cyclus* User Environemnt
-----------------------------------

The disk image provided was primed using Ubuntu 10.04 and comes with
two icons on the desktop. The first simply accesses the terminal, the
second is a text file that is a record of all commands used after 
Ubuntu was installed. This may provide some insight as to how to 
install *Cyclus* for those interested.
